# React GraphQL - Social Media App

Build a Social Media App to learn **GraphQL** following the classes of [Ahmed Hadjou](https://github.com/hidjou)'s Youtube channel [Classed](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMhAeHCz8S3_pgb-j51QnCEhXNj5oyl8n)

## Description

Basically a social media app clone where users can register, login, create posts, like posts, and comment on them.

## Features

I'm going to add the following features to improve on the base project:
- [X] Allow user to edit their post

- [ ] Light/Dark Theme Selector
